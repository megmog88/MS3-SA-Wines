# MileStone Project Three- Park Tavern South African Wine List

A useful data centric website. I am designing a website based on the extensive South African wines the we
offer at the Park Tavern pub in the heart of Southfields. I actually work at the pub and have a great
passion for wine and particularly South African coming from there originaly. I feel this will be a very
useful tool especially over lockdown where we have time to get our guest's to write reviews, especially 
well we are still offering deliveries for wines under current restrictions. As well as a useful time for 
staff members to update their knowledge base and allows them to take time to review the wines. A wise 
person once told me knowledge is power, so I will leave you with that thought well I get on with my website.

### Wireframes
Below I have 2 different Wireframes in order to ensure the design of my project works responsively. 
These were of course the initial design and a few parts have changed due to practicality and more realistic
when visualy looking at the end product.The medium and desktop are the same as it was only smaller 
devices where it had to be changed. Both are in the same folder. 

#### DESKTOP
[Desktop WireFrames]()

#### MOBILE 
[Mobile WireFrames]()

### Color scheme
I have chosen the color scheme that fits with the current website design of Park Tavern SW18 to allow 
fluidity of the site. The colors are neutral and easy on the eye. See the image below for the colors 
used throughout my site.

### Typogrophy
When looking at the typrogrophy of the website I would have liked to explore a few different options but
decided to keep the "Sans-serif" font from google fonts as this is used on the main Park Tavern website 
as when my feature is added I wanted it to keep fluidity and ensure it works professionaly. I added an 
extra font which is  " " from google fonts purely for areas where I wanted a contrasting font to make more
appealing to the eye.

* CSS - A style sheet language used for the design of the web page
* JavaScript - A text based programming language used to make a web page
interactive, in conjunction with HTML and CSS as a base for formatting.
* Python

#### Frameworks

* 
#### Libraries

* W3 Schools [https://www.w3schools.com/] a great base to get refresher materialswhen help was needed.
* Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/] for some tutorials when things where tough

##### GitPod/GitHub
* GitPod was the IDE I used for my project
* GitHub was used to host my website and the repositary

## Testing 

* W3C HTML Validator[https://validator.w3.org/]
* W3C CSS Validator[https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/]
* Autoprefixer CSS[https://autoprefixer.github.io/]
* JavaScript Validator[https://extendsclass.com/javascript-fiddle.html]

![Am I Responsive](assets/images/Amiresponsive.PNG)
* I consistantly was using chrome web developer tools, however when push to my mobile found these to not be the most
accurate. The design was though out to ensure smaller screens were not squished and legible throughout. The layout 
of the other pages are slightly different throughout each breakpoint.

* Tested each page manually to ensure effects worked throughout and responded accordingly.
* Tested manually on teh following devices
    - Iphone 7
    - Ipad 
    - Ipad Pro
    - HP Windows Laptop
    - Mac Book Pro
* Browser Capability- I have tested on the following browsers.
    - Mozilla
    - Microsoft Edge
    - Safari
    - Google Chrome
    - Internet Explorer
    The only one that my site does not work on is Internet Explorer but this is a known issue as I used fetch API
    which is not supported by this browser so a known bug. Internet Explorer is however outdated.

## Testing User Stories
1. As a user in lockdown I can easily be inspired by the many different cocktails displayed on the pageand even 
take a look by my flavour interests.
2. As someone excited to learn new twists I can now do this with a bit of help and guidance
3. As a cocktail lover I can explore other options out there and broaden my horizons
4. As a newbie in hospitality I can now easily acces a lot of information and look good infront of my boss.
5. As a business developer the websoite shows me up to date cocktails and shows me trends in the cocktails. Also
allows me to strengthen my knowledge.
6. The world clearly has a lot more for me to offer and a business owner and making cocktails is definately one of them.
 
## Issues while Testing
* I had a few issues with HTML validator, I corrected some which had bad/unused id's in them, however there are 
two errors in which I have left as it works. The role of button shouldn't have an a link. 
* My CSS came back with 3 errors, however 2 were linked through to bootstrap with unknown attributes. I had one unknown
media query come back. Fixed and sorted. 
* JavaScript- I was just missing a few semi colons that are now in place.
